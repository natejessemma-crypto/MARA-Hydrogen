# MARA: Curvature-First Hydrogen Observables

Reproducible pipeline for MARA (Motion through Asymmetric Resonance & Alignment): alternating-shell recursion on SÂ², scalar kernels, Abel aggregation, and duality-fixed A5.

## Quick start
```bash
pip install -r env/requirements.txt
python scripts/make_results_numbers.py
# compile the LaTeX (or upload with tables/results_numbers.tex)
