# MARA-Hydrogen
MARA: curvature-first framework for precision hydrogen observables. Reproducible pipeline using alternating-shell recursion on SÂ² with scalar kernels, Abel aggregation, and duality-fixed A5. Includes code, configs, data, and scripts to regenerate tables/figures; emits results\_numbers.tex for Overleaf.
